# HazardBuster
A KodeGo Web Project!


HazardBuster is my prototype project utilizing HazardHunterPH, an enchanced one-stop shop for hazard assessment.
Find out if a location is prone to seismic, volcanic, or hydrometeorologic hazards. Generate hazard assessment reports.
See which critical facilities and areas in the Philippines are prone to different hazards.
All hazard information used for assessment has been generated by government agencies.
Know more about HazardHunterPH here.

APIs and functionality will be add as I learn more about Full-Stack Web Development!
